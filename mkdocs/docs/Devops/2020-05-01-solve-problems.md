# How to solve problems

## Personas 

1. Identifying the right problem to slove is the single most important factor for success.
2. Identifying the right problem to slove for your users is finding your team's intent.
3. Focus the outcomes and the experience you want the user to have.

> Key Takeaways:

0. We use personas to help us design for the user's wants and needs. 
1. Focus on outcomes and the experience you want the user to have.
2. Dive into the user's world.
3. Identify User Types based on market research.
3. Create Personas for the most common User Type.
4. Focus on the Persona's wants and needs, and build empathy
5. Encourage all team members to contribute ideas to Persona development.
6. Use simple term / words to describe persona dimensions
7. Make your personas realistic!

## Empathy Maps - Diving into the User's World

> Key Takeaways:

1. Get inside the head and heart of the Persona to understand their concerns, and what's important to them.
2. The quadrants of the Empathy Map are "Says, Thinks, Feels and Does".
3. Feels identifies emotions. Thinks is what goes on in someone's mind.
4. A Persona may say something, but think something else.
5. When doing an Emapthy Map, remember quantity over quality.
6. Quantities of information help you identify opportunities to create delight or remove friction（摩擦） for the Persona.
7. Diverge to contribute lots of ideas individually, and then coverage to discuss and group similiar ideas into themes.
8. When diverging. write. don't speak! Every idea counts!


## As-Is Scenario 

> Key Takeaways:

1. The As-Is Scenario logically follows the Empathy Maps
2. When mapping the As-Is steps, focus on the broader view of the experience
3. Teams will typically work through serval As-Is Scenarios
4. Focus on The persona pain points when identifying the steps taken in their current experience.
5. There are three dimensions used for As-Is scenario mapping (Doing, Thinking, Feeling)
6. Diverge to map out ideas the current experience, then coverage to identify key themes and opportunities
7. Use the As-Is scenario map to create delightful future experiences.


## Brainstorming Ideas

> Key Takeaways:

1. The As-Is Scenario uncovered pain points and opportunities as input for unique ways to create a better experience.
2. Resist the urge to get into solutioning during the Ideaation exercise. Ideation is really about imaging what new outcomes are possible for your Persona.
3. Absurd ideas help lead team towards the realization of brilliant ideas
4. When Ideating, think about the current experience in terms of other industries, and from personal experience.

General tips when Ideating:
- Build on the ideas of others
- Use the "Yes, AND ..." technique (don't judge ideas)
- Encourage wild ideas (haveeach team member offer at least one ABSURD idea)
- Review ideas later
- Stay on topic
- Be visual
- Quantity over quality


## Hills

> Key Takeaways:

- Hills statements always contain a WHO, a WHAT, and a WOW
- Teams should come up with no more than three Hills per project goal.
- Aothough defining them may more complex. Hills statements should end up being very simple
- Understanding the project goal will allow teams to align to a single vision and to make the appropariate vhoices when defining the future experience.
- Use the Persona's pain point help define the Hills.
- Resist the urge to get into solutioning while crafting Hills.
- Focus on the outcomes of the user's experience. What is the problem the team is trying to solve?
- Hills are focused on where do we want to go? versus(与之相对) ... how are we going to get there?


##  Playbacks

> Key Takeaways:

- Align your team, stakeholders and clients around the user value you will deliver 
- Get real! Show your design intention. Make it a concrete(具体的) representation. for example, exptessed as a Persona, the Hills, a storyboard, or a wireframe Being concrete helps avoid misinterpretation(误解), and leads to more effective feedback.
- Make it compelling. Use compelling stories to draw attention and gain feedback. Stories that are easy to remember leads to long term alignment.


##  Prototypes

> Key Takeaways:

- When starting with Prototypes:
    - Tell a stroy
    - Show how the future experience can happen
    - Don't worry about the technical side yet
    - Do a playback with sponsor users and technical stakeholders

- The goal of Prototyping is to elicit(引出) feedback(technical, usability, and business etc.)
- When sketching a Prototype, avoid getting to detailed. Keep the WOW front and center
- Teams should share their sketches to iterate and refine their initial Prototypes



##  To-Be Scenario

> Key Takeaways:

- To map the To_Be Scenario experience, teams will walk through the same process (i.e mapping the Doing, Thinking, and Felling steps) as was done in the As-Is Scenario
- COntinue empathizing with the Persona as you work through the To-Be Scenario steps
- As you work through the To-Be steps, you should see more of the pain points and concerns that your Persona expericenced in the As-Is Scenario change, to become experiences of excitement and the Wow factor
- One reason for conducting the To-Be Scenario map is to refine the experience to make it even better
- If points of friction arise during the To-Be Scenario mapping exercise, continue empathizing wirh the Persona to achieve a more delightful outcome
- When in doubt about ant step in the To-Be Scenario, do more research.

- Use your understanding of a Persona’s current state (i.e. pain points and opportunities) to create a To-Be Scenario map
- Use a To-Be Scenario map to refine a new experience ( or concept) and address any points of friction in the To-Be Scenario map
- Implement techniques to ensure the Wow factor is included in the new experience


## Sponsor Users 

> Key Takeaways:

- Sponsor Users are users or potential(潜在的) users who have experience in the domain required by your design team
- When discussing early stage prototypes with Sponsor Users, design teams may hear signs of recognition and deligh from the Sponsor User. This means their new game day experience design is likely to create a delightful experience for the Persona, but there is still need to playback often and gather more user research, especially as Prototypes become more high-level
- All ideas from Sponsor Users are valid, given their likeness to the Persona!
- You should probe(探测) for more details whrn a Sponsor User shares ideas and particulary if any issue arise with the new design
- Use a low-fidelity prototype to walk through in detail with a Sponsor User
- Use techniques to identify signs of delight and recognition from Sponsor Users
-Use techniques to probe for more prototype feedback from a Sponsor User
